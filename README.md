🏥 VITALS: Sachidanand Health Care - The "Zero-Friction" Smart Hospital Ecosystem Team Name: VITALS Track: Repogenesis - Healthcare Technology Status: Submitted for Review

💡 Project Overview & Solution The modern healthcare experience is marred by fragmentation, financial opacity, and disconnect between care points. Sachidanand Health Care is an integrated digital ecosystem engineered to dismantle these barriers, creating a seamless, transparent flow across the entire patient journey—from admission to post-care recovery.

Our solution is built upon three critical pillars: Smart Administration, Transparent Monitoring, and Digital Therapeutics, transforming the hospital experience from a source of anxiety into a genuine partner in healing.

✨ Key Features & Innovation This platform is a fully integrated full-stack solution with the following core innovations:

Pillar 1: Smart Administration & Financial Transparency Visual Bed Allocation Grid: A standout innovation using a cinema-style booking interface for real-time viewing and selection of specific available beds (General, Private, ICU) within hospital wards.

Advanced Bill Calculator: A crucial financial safeguard that dynamically estimates total costs based on surgery type, room selection, and applied insurance/discounts, ensuring complete financial clarity before admission.

Pillar 2: 'Aarogyam' Diagnostics & Clinical Clarity Aarogyam Diagnostic Hub: Comprehensive module for booking lab tests and scans, paired with a deep Disease Encyclopedia featuring dedicated care cards (Cardiac, Lung, Cancer) and prevention protocols.

Live Patient Health Board: A real-time medical journal for inpatients, auto-updating every 6 hours with vitals, history, and new reports, granting families peace of mind.

Remote Consultation: Integration of Jitsi-powered video consultations to bridge the doctor-patient gap for remote and follow-up care.

Pillar 3: Digital Therapeutics & Post-Care Logistics Gamified Rehab Modules: Interactive web-based games designed for therapeutic benefit, including modules for stroke recovery and panic attack management, turning therapy into an engaging daily habit.

QR-Code Prescription Backups: Addresses the issue of lost paperwork by providing digital, QR-coded backups of prescriptions.

Full-Stack E-Pharmacy with Granular Logistics: Closes the loop on care by allowing patients to track medicine delivery step-by-step—from "Order Placed" to "Delivered"—ensuring medication compliance.
